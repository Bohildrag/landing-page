This is a landing-page of The Odin Project, this page is a 
easy but beautiful basic landing page.
 It corresponds to the FlexBox section, the last practice of the section.
I personalized it to my liking, with another theme, an apology for the Spanish language.
An English version will be coming soon.


(Temporarily the linked pages will be external, then I'll take care of making them.)
